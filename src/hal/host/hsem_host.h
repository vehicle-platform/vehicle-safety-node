/*
 * Host model of the STM32H7 HSEM (hal/hsem.h) for the mailbox tests (D-093 item 6): two
 * cores, one owner word per semaphore (compiler __atomic builtins, visible to
 * ThreadSanitizer: a take is an acquire, a release a release), the one-step same-core
 * re-take of the real HSEM, and injected contention:
 *   - hsem_host_force_busy(): the next n takes of an ID fail, whoever asks;
 *   - hsem_host_seize(): a core holds an ID until hsem_host_release_as();
 *   - a hook that runs after every successful take while the lock is held (to yield or
 *     sleep, widening the windows of the two-thread tests).
 * The calling thread's core is thread-local (hsem_host_set_core(), default M4 in this
 * repo; the tests' model of the M7 switches its thread to M7).
 * Forked from vehicle-rt-core commit c7a8243 (the rt-core#62 merge, after v0.12.0; code identical at 333f203, the current fork ref) (default core changed).
